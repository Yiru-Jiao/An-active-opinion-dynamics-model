# Abstract
Opinion dynamics models have been successfully applied to simulate the aggregation and polarization of public opinion, culture, and language. However, passive interactions initiated by locational or social relationships are hardly enough to characterize purposeful group behaviors, where people are driven by their internal causes. Here we propose an active model in which people tend to communicate with someone who is more likely to be an ally, and evaluate gain and loss before deciding whether to interact. Simulations of the model highlight the macroscopic results of opinion evolution such as stabilized group opinion and voting result, showing a wide stubbornness of group opinion and an insecure necessity of voting result representing the collective opinion of a group. Our results help explain why sometimes voting result fails to embody public will, and additionally, the probability distribution of group opinion change contribute to predict how group opinion will change after evolution.
